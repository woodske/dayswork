# AI-DLC Audit Log — Dayswork SMAPI Mod

## Initial User Request
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-18T00:00:00Z
**User Input**: "@C:\Users\kwood\Downloads\dayswork-mod-spec.md Using AI-DLC, review this markdown spec file as a starting point. The goal is to create a Stardew Valley mod which lets the player hire a farmhand. I am an experience software engineer, but not familiar with C# or best practices for writing stardew valley mods, so that needs to be apart of this inception phase."
**AI Response**: Loaded spec file from `C:\Users\kwood\Downloads\dayswork-mod-spec.md`. Acknowledged that user is an experienced software engineer but new to C# and Stardew Valley modding, so onboarding and tech-stack/best-practices guidance must be part of the inception. Beginning Workspace Detection.
**Context**: Workflow start — initial request

## Workspace Detection
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-18T00:00:01Z
**User Input**: (none — automated stage)
**AI Response**: Scanned `C:\Users\kwood\Repos\dayswork`. Found only `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.git/`, and `.aidlc-rule-details/`. No source files, no build artifacts, no `aidlc-docs/` directory. Determined this is a **greenfield** project. Created `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` and `aidlc-docs/audit.md`. Copied the user-provided spec to `aidlc-docs/inception/source-spec.md` for reference.
**Context**: INCEPTION — Workspace Detection (greenfield, skipping Reverse Engineering)

## Requirements Analysis — Clarifying Questions Generated
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-18T00:00:02Z
**User Input**: (none — generation step)
**AI Response**: Performed intent analysis (request type: new project; scope: system-wide; complexity: complex). Selected **Comprehensive depth** because spec involves money/items at stake, multi-component architecture, NPC AI, and persistence — and because the user explicitly asked for C#/SMAPI best-practices guidance. Created `aidlc-docs/inception/requirements/requirement-verification-questions.md` with 29 questions across 5 groups: (A) Tech stack & developer experience, (B) Resolving spec's open questions, (C) Critical edge cases, (D) UX & scope, (E) Mandatory extension opt-ins (Security Baseline, Property-Based Testing). Awaiting user answers.
**Context**: INCEPTION — Requirements Analysis, Step 6 (gate: awaiting user answers)

## Requirements Analysis — User Request: Walk Through Questions Interactively
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-18T00:00:03Z
**User Input**: "go through them one at a time for me"
**AI Response**: Honored the request via the harness's interactive question UI (`AskUserQuestion`), one question per prompt, recording answers into the `requirement-verification-questions.md` file as they came in.
**Context**: INCEPTION — Requirements Analysis, Step 6 (interactive walkthrough)

## Requirements Analysis — Change Request from Review Gate
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-18T00:00:05Z
**User Input**: "FR-TASK-04 animal products can also be deposited into the shipping bin"
**AI Response**: Updated `requirements.md`: FR-TASK-02 now lists Harvest crops, Collect fruit, AND Collect animal products as the shipping-bin-or-chest tasks. FR-TASK-04 rewritten to reference FR-TASK-02 for destination selection (removing the hardcoded "designated chest"). No downstream FRs needed updating (FR-HIRE-06 is already generic over "tasks that produce output", and FR-OUT-06 already covers shipping-bin behavior). Re-presenting the Review Required gate.
**Context**: INCEPTION — Requirements Analysis, Step 9 (post-completion change request)

## Requirements Analysis — Stuck-Handling Discussion + Decision
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-18T00:00:06Z
**User Input**: "what should happen if the worker gets stuck mid shift? say the player creates a fence around the worker, what are some options for handling that?"
**AI Response**: Presented four options inline (A: wait+emote+abandon, B: wait+emote+teleport silently, C: hybrid escalation, D: chop/break through). Recommended C as most consistent with prior decisions (no items lost, invulnerable worker, sleep fast-forwards shift).
**Context**: INCEPTION — Requirements Analysis, Step 9 (new gap surfaced during review)

## Requirements Analysis — IDE Revised
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-18T00:00:08Z
**User Input**: "IDE for development will be Visual Studio 2026"
**AI Response**: Updated §6 Key Decisions row to "Visual Studio 2026" and annotated Q3 in the questions file. No FR/NFR changes needed (no specific VS-version requirement is encoded elsewhere). Re-presenting the Review Required gate.
**Context**: INCEPTION — Requirements Analysis, Step 9 (post-completion change request)

## Requirements Analysis — Stuck-Handling Decision Confirmed
**Timestamp**: 2026-05-18T00:00:07Z
**User Input**: "yes, C"
**AI Response**: Added FR-WORK-11 (stuck detection, default 10 in-game minute threshold), FR-WORK-12 (3-step hybrid escalation: emote → teleport to next task tile → teleport home and end shift), FR-WORK-13 (thresholds configurable via GMCM). Added decision row to §6 Key Decisions Captured.
**Context**: INCEPTION — Requirements Analysis, Step 9 (change applied)
